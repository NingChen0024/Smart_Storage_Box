# Smart_Storage_Box
This project is called smart Footorage, which makes use of physical sensors, embedded systems board and IOS-based application 
on the user's smartphone to provide consistent service on monitoring the food storage environment condition and predicting 
the freshness condition of food stored in the IoT equipment. The system is integrated with multiple sensors, which include 
a temperature sensor, air pressure sensor, humidity sensor, color sensor, light sensor, gas sensor and camera, etc. 
The data gathered by all those sensors will be analyzed by some kind of algorithms to provide a high-level situation 
that provides users with useful information instead of a bunch of raw data. 

The system will make use of image recognition technology to recognize the type and the quantity of the food stored in a certain space. 
These data about foods that are gathered and extracted by the camera will then be analyzed along with environment 
data (temperature, humidity, air pressure, gas component, strength of illumination) in order to get the freshness condition of the 
food and predict how long the food can be stored in such environmental condition and the deadline that the food can be consumed.
